# React Express Template
## About / Synopsis

* An organization of typescript Express backend and React frontend
* Project status: working/prototype



## Installation
Navigate to bash/shell/cmd
```console
cd root
npm install
```

## Usage

You can plug in your controllers/middleware/services into the specifically marked folders for the backend

For the frontend you can add your components and add them in App.js to be rendered. You can define your api calls to the express server in frontend-client/src/api/api.js

Axios is what I generally use but the implementation is not forced in this template
